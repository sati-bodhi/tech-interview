# Technical Interviews 

This is a compilation of all the technical interviews I have been through so far. 

The koobits challenge was to implement a miniature data pipeline with Blender to automatically compile videos with clips from the web. 

The Coderbyte challenge was part of the Koobits interview question, which tasks the candidate to return the longest repeating pattern in a string. 

The SuDoResearch challenge was to come up with various algorithms that help group things together.
